Do you wanna see that?
Do you wanna do that?
So let's play the game til the night
What is confused in my mind?
Tell me what I am for you
I swear that it is not a cure
Maybe this is just contagious
This feeling is getting worse

Take on all your tears away from me
I don't want my life to be a lie
Oh oh oh oh
This insanity doesn't exist
I don't want my life to be a lie
Oh oh oh oh
I don't want my life to be a lie

I can feel your feel through your eyes
And you're hand trembling in the dark
My chest is about to explode
This situation is the way I've made
What kind of regrets would you have?
Take a chance it will be alright
We're not in my plans at all
This feeling is getting worse

Take on all your tears away from me
I don't want my life to be a lie
Oh oh oh oh
This insanity doesn't exist
I don't want my life to be a lie
Oh oh oh oh
I don't want my life to be a lie

You don't realize what you say
I'm not a mistake, I'm human
You don't understand what I say
I'm not a mistake, you're the problem

Take on all your tears away from me
I don't want my life to be a lie
Oh oh oh oh
This insanity doesn't exist
I don't want my life to be a lie
Oh oh oh oh
I don't want my life to be a lie
