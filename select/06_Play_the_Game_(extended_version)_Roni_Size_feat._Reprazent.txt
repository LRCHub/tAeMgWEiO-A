It dawned on me, hypocrisy
Certain things upholding me
But I didn't do it
You did and I knew it
What is this double-talk?
He wants it all but won't recall
Tears as they reached the end
Curtains call, we pretend
This tragedy is hard to call
Our words are passing particles
Of ups and downs and turnarounds
Nothing fierce can be tied down
No travelling side trek
No easy day-trip
A waiting time-bomb
Fatal outcome
It's a simple security
I've won, but you're holding me
With power and reliance,
Confidence, defiance
You're a natural liar
I'm an easy rider
Our signals are the same
We all play the game
